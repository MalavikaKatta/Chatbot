Customer: I'm in Ciudad Juarez and I have to transport a little "package" with me across the border. It has to be done between September 8 and the 28th. We are going to make this a family trip, like in that movie We are the Millers. LOL.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where are you travelling?
Customer: Anywhere which gets us across the border. LOL.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I don’t understand. How many of you are travelling?
Customer: We are 3 adults and 3 kids.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can get the six of you to Rosario, Argentina for $18194.
Customer: I need to find something for under $14800
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a 2 star hotel in Rosario for 13646.60USD. The stay would last 18 days,
Customer: From when to when?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): September 10-27.
Customer: Those dates seem to work and the price is more suitable. I'll take that one.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure! Do you want any more details before I proceed with the booking?
Customer: No, just need to get across the border.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok, I’ll just book it for you now then.
Customer: Thank you
Customer Service Agent (CSA): My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:
