Customer: Hi I need to go to BA
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can look into that for you. What is your city of origin?
Customer: I am presently in North Vancouver. Would like to leave around Sept 2 and come back around Sept 15
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have 10, 13 and 16 day trips available around those dates. Which length would you prefer?
Customer: 10 sounds good as long as I am back by the 15th
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can offer you a package from September 7th to the 15th. You would stay at the Olive Market Hotel, a 4 star hotel in the heart of Buenos Aires. The trip costs 2488.15USD and I could upgrade you to business class flights if your budget allows it.
Customer: This package sounds perfect. Can you tell what it's located close to and whether it has free wifi?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is close to a park and not only does it have free wifi, it also includes free breakfast and parking. Would you like me to book it for you?
Customer: yes that was quick, thank you!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great! I'm glad we found what you needed.
