Customer: Hey I'd love to bring my 4 kids to go see their mom who's currently working in Washington, could you find me a flight?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes! This will be 1 adult and 4 children?
Customer: yes please
Customer Service Agent (CSA): And where will you fly out from?
Customer: We live in Boston
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have a budget or dates you would like to leave and/or return on?
Customer: Nah we're flexible. As long as I can take my kids to go see their mother.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I am sorry to inform you that we have no flights from Boston to Washington. Is there somewhere else you can fly to?
Customer: What! It's going to be difficult dragging 4 kids around, but sure I guess we can try Phoenix instead of Washington.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Lucky for you we have packages for Phoenix. How long would you like your stay to be?
Customer: I guess the longer packages would be great, thanks.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Okay, our longest package is 10 days. The hotel is 2.5 stars, with a 7.06/10 guest rating, near the airport and a museum, and the hotel provides free breakfast, parking, and wifi. This package is from September 21st to 30th.
Customer: How much would that cost?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): For business or economy flights?
Customer: I'm wondering for both, please.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): For economy it is 2167.71 and business is 2556.30.
Customer: I'll fly business please! The kids will have a lot of fun with that.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Awesome! Your package has been booked and you should receive your confirmation email within the next 20 minutes! Have a great trip!
Customer: Thanks!
