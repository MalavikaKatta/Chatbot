Customer: Madonna and Will Smith are on a trip to Houston. A picture of them is worth millions. I need to go to Houston.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Okay. Where are you leaving from?
Customer: Ciudad Juarez, and I'm on a strict budget of 2800 USD.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Travelling alone?
Customer: Yes sir! No one else can know about this.
Customer Service Agent (CSA):  Do you have travel dates in mind?
Customer: I need to leave on August 17th. So I'm already late.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How long do you want to be in Houston?
Customer: As long as my budget will carry me for.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry but there are no trips from Ciudad Juarez to Houston. Would you be able to leave from somewhere else?
Customer: But I NEED to go there! What if I increased by budget to 3800 dollars?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm sorry but there are no results for your request in my database.
Customer: Oh no... I'll have to go to a different agency.
