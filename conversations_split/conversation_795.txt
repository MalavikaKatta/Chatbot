Customer: hmmm.... i think the 3 star hotel with 6.91/10 guest rating sounds good. What is that hotel close to?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): That is an excellent choice! That hotel is located at the heart of the city, close to a cathedral and a theater.
Customer: Does the hotel have free wifi?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You bet! It also offers free breakfast.
