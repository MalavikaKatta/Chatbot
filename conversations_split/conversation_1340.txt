Customer: Hi there, my team and I are thinking of going to Monterrey please.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! From where?
Customer: We all work together in Kabul.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Iâ€™m sorry, but we do not have any trips out of Kabul.
Customer: Oh really? That's too bad. I guess we'll have to look elsewhere then. Thank you for your services.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes, sorry I could not be of more service.
