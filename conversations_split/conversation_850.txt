Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry, we don't have any availabilities for Santo Domingo to Birmingham. Are there nearby cities you can land at or depart from?
Customer: no but i could go to Ulsan instead
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We can get you to Ulsan! When would you like to go? And how long would you like to stay?
Customer: it doesnt matter
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How much are you planning on spending?
Customer: it doesnt matter
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Are you going on your own?
Customer: yep
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I would recommend you our best package to Ulsan. It is a stay at a luxurious 5 star hotel, with 8.98/10 guest rating.  It boasts free parking, free wifi, and convenient access to a park, a market, and a theater. I can offer a 9 day package or a 14 day package.
Customer: wow that perfect, are there any other package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The second best would be a 9 day package at a 4.0 star hotel, rated 7.06/10 by guests. This hotel also offers free parking and wifi, and is next to a market and a palace.
