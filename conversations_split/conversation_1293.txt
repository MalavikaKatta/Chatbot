Customer: Get the 17 of us out of Tofino for a few days! The majority of us want to go to Lima so let's see deals for those!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we have no flights operating out of Tofino. Would you like to leave from somewhere else?
Customer: Ah no :disappointed: We're based in Tofino
