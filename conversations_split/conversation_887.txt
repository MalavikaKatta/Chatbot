Customer: Do you have packages leaving Friday September 16 from Denver?? I got 11 days
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We do! Do you have a budget in mind?
Customer: No budget! Find me something snazzy
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Well, we have a trip to Leon, Tijuana, Rosario, Maceio, and Punta Cana!
Customer: What kind of hotel in Leon!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is a 5 star hotel near a market
Customer: what are the amenities?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): A spa!
Customer: What are the dates for this package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): September 24th to October 4th.
Customer: Would you be able to offer free breakfast to enjoy by the spa?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately the hotel does not accommodate for free breakfast
Customer: how much would i be paying then, if breakfast isn't even included
Customer Service Agent (CSA): 2153.39 for economy class flights or 2729.19 for business class flights
Customer: I see. Can you check if there's a good hotel in Tijuana as well?
Priority goes to the ones that offer free breakfast!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): This has a 2.5 star hotel near a park, 6.77/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 18th to 28th. The business class package is 1542.79 and the economy class package is 1229.30.
Customer: Free breakfast is a big plus, but I'm a little iffy on the stars. Whats on offer in Rosario?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I think you will like this one. It is a 4 star hotel close to shopping hot spots, 8.86/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 18th to 28th also, business class package comes to 3104.39, and the economy package comes to 2418.78.
Customer: You're right! Its quite ideal. I've already been to Punta Cana so that's not a destination I'd consider, but can you just quickly check Maceio for similarly attractive hotels?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): This is a 3.5 star hotel close to a park, market, and theatre, 8.8/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 17th to 27th, business package costing 3680.67, and economy package costing 2868.83.

Customer Service Agent (CSA): Business or economy?
Customer: Economy please
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great! Your flights are booked and you will get an email confirming your bookings! Have a great day and thank you for booking!
