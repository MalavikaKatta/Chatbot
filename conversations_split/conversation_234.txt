Customer: Hey I live in Mos Eisley and I need to book a flight!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can't seem to find any flights out of Mos Eisley. Would you like to try another departure destination?
Customer: I could drive to Columbus and try to leave out of there instead
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In that case, I can offer you a four-day package to Seattle for 311.64USD. Would you like to hear more about this package?
Customer: Where would I have to fly out of to go to Ulsan then?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can book you a flight to Ulsan from Columbus. You would be stayong at the Grandiose Willow Resort for 12 days, bringing your total cost to 2645.30USD. However, if you are flexible on your city of departure, I can book you a package that leaves from Hiroshma, Japan that is only 228.28USD. Would you like to hear more about either of these packages?
Customer: My travel dates are from August 15 to August 24. Does the package out of Columbus (to Ulsan)  meet my requirements?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately all available packages from Columbus to Ulsan depart on the 27th of August.
Customer: And if I leave from Hiroshma?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately the 27th of August is the closest date of departure I can give you if you are leaving from Hiroshma.
Customer: okay thank you good bye
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Thank you for using our service! Have a nice day!
