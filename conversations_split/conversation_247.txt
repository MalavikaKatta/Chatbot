Customer: Hi, I am the team manager for the Phoenix Sportsteam and I need to book the guys a short vacation, they need to relax for a few days. We are having a crappy season.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where would you like to go and do you have a set of dates in mind?
Customer: No but as soon as possible. We are 25.  We need to do this for under $2800.00.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a 7 day package to the Glorious Bazaar Resort in Kyoto for 2773.26USD. Does this interest you?
Customer: It sure does babe. What's your name, anyway?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Departure is Thursday August 25th at 10:37am. You return on August 31st at 5:37 am.
Customer: That sounds good, let's book that. Next time I want to speak to a real person, preferably female. Thank you.
