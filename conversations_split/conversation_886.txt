Customer: Hey man.  Sick of having my picture taken. Need somewhere quiet and away from everyone. Tijuana is probably a town no one wants to go to. Can you get me a ticket there?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure! Leaving from where?
Customer: London, England. Way too much paparazzi here. It's like a wolf den.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have 11 days at a 2.5 hotel near a park for 1290.36USD in Tijuana, Mexico. This package departs from London, Canada.
Customer: Is it a 5 star? I'm travelling with my diva friend and she won't settle for anything but the absolute best. Find us a spa or something.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): As I said, this hotel is 2.5 stars. There is also the Resort Jade Covert available with a 3.0 star rating.
Customer: 5 stars only for my girlfriend and I.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): There are no 5 star hotels in Tijuana that I can find for you.
Customer: Burlington then. 5 stars only.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Once again I have only 2.5-3 star hotels.
Customer: That just won't do. What if I leave from Denver instead? Anything better in Tijuana?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Still just 2.5 or 3 star hotels, sadly.
Customer: In Burlington?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Below 3 stars.
Customer: You know, I'm just gonna have my assistant take care of this, she'll get me a beautiful retreat with a spa and guards to keep the paparazzi away.  Good riddance, whatever the hell your name is!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Goodbye!
