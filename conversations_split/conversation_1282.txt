Customer: I want to go to Barcelona from anywhere between the 12th and the 28th of September. I have 2100 and my assistant will be coming along. I am specifically looking for hotels near a park or beach or both.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have 2 different hotels available in Barcelona but the Nova Resort is the only one located near a park. How long would you like to stay in Barcelona?
Customer: I'm not picky, i'm travelling for work. What is the hotel near the park like?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is in the downtown area close to a park and the university, it has 3 star rating witn an excellent guest rating of 9.16 om 5 and has wifi included along with parking. The price for a 10 day package is  1453.6USD, but it is also available for 9 days at 1725.59USD on a different date.
