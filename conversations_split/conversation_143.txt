Customer: i want ot travel to melbourne. i will leave from kyoto
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately there are no flights heading from Kyoto to Melbourne. How about Sapporo?
Customer: i can leave from berlin
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately there are no flights heading from Berlin to Melbourne. How about Munich?
Customer: ok well i would go to Caprica as well
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately there are no flights from Berlin headed to Caprica. How About Hamburg?
Customer: no not hamburg, i have an outstanding warrant there. i would go to Naples instead
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In that case, I would recommend flying in from Berlin, as I can offer you a six-night package at the Courtyard Resort for 640.85 USD if you leave on August 19. Would you like me to book this package?
Customer: I want to try to travel between august 15 and august 18
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately the closest package I can offer you to those specifications is from the 15th of August until the 27th. Otherwise the earliest you could leave would be August 19th.
Customer: ok, i can be flexible on the dates... i will book the package leaving on the 19th for 15 people
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately with a party of 15 people you would need to leave by the 24th or stay until the 31st. Are either of these options OK?
Customer: lets book it
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Your trip has been booked! Enjoy your stay!
Customer: sweet thank you
