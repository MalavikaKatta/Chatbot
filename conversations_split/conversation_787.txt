Customer: I never been much good at maths. We way overcalculated what we would be spending my wedding on September 7, and only have 1600 left over :disappointed: Wifey is so mad at me
But is that enough to get us from Leon to Rome, for lets say 8 days?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It sure is! When would you like to travel?
Customer: Anytime after our wedding
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can offer 12 days, with business class flights and a 4 star hotel, for 1007 USD
Customer: You are a lifesaver. Book it
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! The hotel features free breakfast, free wifi, and is near a cathedral to bask in your holy matrimony.
Customer: You really think of everything, donâ€™t you?
