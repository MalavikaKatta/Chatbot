Customer: Hey I need to get out of here, just need some space to myself!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure :slightly_smiling_face: Where are you looking to get out of?
Customer: Seattle! I just need a break from all the performing all those cameras. My best friend will be coming with me. We're thinking of going to Minneapolis
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a lovely 2.5 star hotel in Minneapolis for a 9 day stay.
Customer: 2.5 stars? Are you kidding me? Do you think I'm a 2.5 star kind of person? I think I deserve much better than that! Give me the best you got!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I only have 2.5 star hotels available in Minneapolis.
Customer: Let's try Punta Cana then, there's got to be something better there!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Certainly! I have 3 and 3.5 star hotels available in Punta Cana. Which one would you like to hear about first?
Customer: 3.5 only? I guess if that's the best you've got... I also need to get back by October 1st at the latest for my gig.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a package leaving Sept 26 and returning to Seattle on the 1st!. 6 days at 3.5 star rated Sunrise Elephant Hotel. It has 8.69/10 from past users, is near a cathedral and a palace, and includes free wifi and parking.
Customer: That sounds pretty good. But do you have anything longer?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No- this is the longest trip available.
Customer: Fine, if that's the best you got, I'll take it.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes, of course. Expect email confirmation shortly.
Customer: Cool!
