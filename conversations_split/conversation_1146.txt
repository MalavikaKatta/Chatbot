Customer: Hi there I'd like to take my family on vacation.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! Where?
Customer: We haven't decided on a destination yet, but we'll be leaving from Boston.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! When can you travel? And how many of you are there?
Customer: We'll be 4 adults and 1 child, looking for a trip between Monday September 12 and Saturday October 1st.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! I have a lovely trip for you to Goiania that would cost 12388.4USD for your whole family. The hotel is Scarlet Palms Resort which is 3.5 stars and is located near both parks and shopping districts.
Customer: That does sound pretty good. How many days is that?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): 13 days.
Customer: It does suit my budget, which is 14700 maximum. But I am curious about other destinations.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You can all travel to Light View Hotel in Columbus and spend 18 days for only 4697.60USD.
Customer: Whoa that's amazing. But we're looking for somewhere more exotic, so preferably somewhere outside the continent, if possible!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How about 17 days in New York for 3487.19USD?
Customer: Isn't that still in the US? Can you suggest another interesting place for me? Maybe with a four or five star hotel?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The highest rated hotels I am seeing are the Light View and Scarlet Palms hotels in Columbus and Goiania, respectively.
Customer: What are the travel dates for the Goiania package please?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): September 13-October 1.
Customer: Wow, that's perfect! Yes, please book this trip for us! My family will be so happy!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok - consider it booked :slightly_smiling_face:
Customer: Perfect! Thank you.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No problem.
