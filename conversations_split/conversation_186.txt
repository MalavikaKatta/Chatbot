Customer: Hi
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Okay. So where would you like to go and where are you leaving from?
Customer: Well, I need to find a place where the paparazzi won't find me. I was thinking of Phoenix. Madonna and I are leaving from Cairo.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have dates in mind?
Customer: Yes, well, I'd like to leave as soon as possible, but I need to be back by September 7.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The best I can offer for Phoenix is a 3 star hotel, offers free breakfast, wifi, and parking. The price for this package is 1767.71.
Customer: I will only look at 5 star hotels.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm sorry but there are no 5 star hotels for these two destinations. Is there somewhere else you would be willing to go?
Customer: Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The best I can offer is a 2.5 star hotel.
Customer: I refuse to stay in anything under 4 stars.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Everything available is under 4 stars. I apologize.
Customer: Good day.
