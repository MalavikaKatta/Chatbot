Customer: Hi I've got 9 days free and I'm looking for a vacation. I live in San Francisco.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Absolutely! Where do you want to go and when do you want to go there?
Customer: No, dates or places in mind. Was hoping you could help me. Something as cheap as possible.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have a budget?
Customer: Just something crazy cheap.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have 9 days at the Cosmos Inn in Kingston for $2764.
Customer: That's not crazy cheap
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can't accomodate your request
Customer: what's the cheapest you got?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The cheapest package I can see at this point is to Mexico City for 1061.36USD.
Customer: How about a budget of $400?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have one trip under 400 - 7 days at the Crown Jungle Inn in Columbus for 399.8USD.
Customer: Yes let's go with that!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! I will go ahead and book it for you. Would you like further information first?
