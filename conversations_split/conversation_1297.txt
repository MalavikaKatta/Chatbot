Customer: Recife to Pittsburgh for 4 adults. Only 5 star hotels
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I only have 2.5 star rated hotels in Pittsburgh
Customer: Check Fukuoka then
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In Fukuoka, my search only turns up 3.5 star rated hotels
Customer: Vancouver?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I don't have any 5 star rated hotels there either but I do have the Western Ridge with a rating of 4 and a perfect guest rating of 10/10.
Customer: yeah but the hotel isn't 5 stars. You should try harder to find me a 5 star hotel, it's my birthday!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately, we do not have any 5 star rated hotels available in any of those cities at this time
