Customer: Hi! I need to book an emergency trip for 10 adults and 14 children!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where are you leaving from and where would you like to go?
Customer: I'm leaving from Kyoto and I want to go to Diagon Alley!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have a budget and/or dates that you want to travel?
Customer: I have a budget of 3500 and I have no time frame for the trip, I can leave any time.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm sorry to inform you that there are no flights to Diagon Alley. Is there somewhere else you'd like to visit?
Customer: No... I really need to go there to steal a legendary recipe from pastry chef that I have long battled with for the best croissants!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Well I am very sorry but there are no results for Diagon Alley in my database.
Customer: I am sorry too. Now I will lose the title of best croissant maker. Goodbye!
