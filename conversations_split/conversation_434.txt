Customer: I work in Sendai and I need to get out of here. I'm willing to blow all my savings
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great idea :slightly_smiling_face: Where would you like to gO?
Customer: The only thing is that my dates are not flexible, I can only by from work (aka hell-hole) from August 30th to September 11th. And i was hoping to leave for 11 days
Do you have anything to Santos in that time frame?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I sure do! However, the longest duration I have for you is 7 days. Would you like to hear more about this option?
Customer: Sure, give me all the details and I'll see what my options are
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok, so the Starlight would cost 5531 dollars for a 7 day stay from September 3-7. It is a 3.5 star hotel near a museum and a palace, has a 8.8/10 guest rating, and has free wifi and free breakfast.
Customer: My other destination is Hiroshima
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have two different hotels available in Hiroshima within your date range, but both packages are only 4 days in length.
Customer: 4 days!! That's way to short for me. How about Toronto, anything long and sweet for me there?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a 6 day stay at Hotel Eric Perrier near Toronto airport and a cathedral available from Sept 2-6. Eric Perrier boasts a 4 star rating with free wifi and breakfast included. The cost for this package would be $3348.
Customer: And that's the longest one you have?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Iâ€™m sorry to tell you that it is the only option we have in Toronto leaving from Sendai for you.
Customer: Ok give me the Santos one then! One extra day of bliss with that one haha
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure thing :slightly_smiling_face: Anything else I can help you with today?
Customer: That's all! Now there is a light at the end of my tunnel :stuck_out_tongue:
