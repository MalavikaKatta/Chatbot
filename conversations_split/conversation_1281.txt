Customer: Anything to Minneapolis from Calgary?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How many people is this for and are you on a strict budget?
Customer: No budget in mind.. And I'll be traveling solo! Although I can only go between Sept 8-18.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes, we have one package that lasts 8 days at just a mere 556.43 for economy class! Are you interested in booking this trip?
Customer: That's really cheap! Is it a good hotel?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It's 2.5 stars with a guest rating of 7.15/10. There's a university nearby and it includes free breakfast, parking, and wifi. Does this interest you?
Customer: Is there another option?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): That's all we have, I'm afraid! You can only choose between business and economy. What will you decide?
Customer: Don't think I can decide anything until you help me see what's in Dallas first.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid there is nothing to be found in Dallas.
Customer: Is there a business class option for the Minneapolis trip?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes indeed! It costs a grand total of 633.72! Shall I book this trip for you?
Customer: When does this trip begin?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You leave on Thursday September 8th and return the 15th! Shall I proceed with booking?
Customer: Alright that works! Please proceed with business class!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Your booking has now been processed. Enjoy your stay :slightly_smiling_face:
