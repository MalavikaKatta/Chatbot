Customer: I NEED TO GET OUT OF NORTH VANCOUVER ON SEPTEMBER 8TH. CAN I GET A FLIGHT TO DUBLIN?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Why yes of course! We have a 13 day package costing 1181.12 for economy class leaving North Vancouver on September 14th. How does that sound?

Customer Service Agent (CSA): The earliest flight we have is September 11th. 
Customer: NO I NEED TO LEAVE ON THE 8TH. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING LEAVING FROM CLEVELAND

Customer: NO BUT I CAN GO TO SACRAMENTO
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm sorry, our earliest flight is still September 11th. How else can I help you?
