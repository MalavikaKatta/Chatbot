Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have a budget?
Customer: No budget. I just want it to be fabulous!

Customer: Do any of the packages in Punta Cana have a spa? :haircut:
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately they do not.
Customer: Are any of the packages in Punta Cana at a 5 star rated hotel or close to the beach?
