Customer: im broke but wanna dip out of north vancouver
Customer Service Agent (CSA): If you give me your budget, where you would like to go, and when you would like to go, I'll see what I can do.
Customer: im broke ok
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Alright. The cheapest possible way out North Vancouver I can get for you, as unbelievable as it sounds, is a 9 day trip to San Juan for 127.38.
Customer: ok well i can swing 400 bucks. anything else?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Nope, it can still only get you to San Juan. Although you can choose to stay 9 or 10 days and afford to fly on business class if you'd like.
Customer: uyeah ok well i wanna go for 10 days then in that case
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Alright, a 10 days stay + business flights to San Juan will be 189.83. Would you like me to book it?
Customer: yes book
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Done! You are getting out of North Vancouver :slightly_smiling_face:
Customer: thanks ur dope
