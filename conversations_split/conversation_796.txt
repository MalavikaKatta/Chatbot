Customer: Hello, kind stranger.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Would you like to go from Calgary to Vancouver?
Customer: I would like to go from Athens to Ulsan
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! How many will be travelling?
Customer: I, my wife, and our infant son.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Let me see what I can find :slightly_smiling_face: Do you have a budget?
Customer: Our budget is 6700. Not a penny more.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I’m sorry, it seems I cannot accommodate a child on that budget. I can find you something if just two adults are travelling?
Customer: Burlington.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I’m sorry, but I cannot get you from Athens to Burlington on 6700 dollars.
Customer: Then I will not be making use of your services.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry :disappointed:
