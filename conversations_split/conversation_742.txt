Customer: Yo! I've rounded the crew up and we want to do something huge
Customer Service Agent (CSA): OK :slightly_smiling_face: How many are in your group?
Customer: We have 7 adults. Leaving from Phoenix
We all got September 6 to 26 blocked off
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Any destination in mind?
Customer: What would a trip to Kingston look like?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Iâ€™ve got a couple options in Kingston for you. To help me narrow them down, could you provide me with a budget for your trip? Or perhaps a desired length of stay?
Customer: We have 27100 between the 7 of us. Whats the longest trip you can find?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The longest trip would be 9 days. You would be staying at the Cosmos Inn, a 2.5. star hotel with a 6.37 guest rating; it is near a park in the heart of the city.
Customer: I'm sure we can do better! Can we go to Hamburg then?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Would you like a higher hotel rating?
Customer: Sure, or that
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In Hamburg I can offer you 10 days at either a 3 or 4 star hotel in the heart of Hamburg.
Customer: tell us more about the 4 star
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The Traveller Inn has free breakfast and free wifi. It has been well received by guests with its 8.69 user review rating.
Customer: Thats not bad. Wait could you find a better hotel in Kingston tho?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can offer a 3.5 star hotel near a museum for 8 days in Kingston?
Customer: Would that cost more or less than the 10 days at the Traveller?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): That would cost 10269.29USD, while the Hamburg package would cost 20741.24USD.
Customer: Wow lets go with that then, the difference in pricing is astronomical
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Certainly! I will book the Kingston package for you all.
