Customer: Hi I work for a big multinational corporation and they are sending me to San Diego. I'm presently working out of Tokyo.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Hi there. What is your intended departure date and will you have any colleagues joining you?
Customer: No it's my first time traveling alone. I'm looking forward to it. I just want to make sure I make the right decision on where to do my internship. It's crucial to my career.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): And what dates would you like to travel between?
Customer: 25 August - 31 August
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have packages starting at 3677.6USD to San Diego for 5 days. Do you have a price limit for this trip?
Customer: It's $4800 but I rather not spend it all. What do you have to Mannheim?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can offer you 5 days at the 5 star Regal Resort for 3031.30USD. The hotel includes free wifi and a spa.
Customer: Better deal than San Diego and we have an office in Mannheim too :grinning: can you give me dates to make sure they work well?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Departure is the 27th of August and you would return on the 30th.
