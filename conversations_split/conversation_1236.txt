Customer Service Agent (CSA): No problem! Do you have a budget in mind?
Customer: 4800 and id like to stay there for 3 days
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we don't have anything that fits your budget. Would it be possible to expand your budget?
Customer: no but we can try going to hiroshima too
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we don't have anything that fits your budget for that either. Would you like to try another destination?
Customer: no but we can stay for 9 days instead of 3
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we don't have anything that fits your budget. Is there anything else I can help you with?
