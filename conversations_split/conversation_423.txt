Customer: Hi My cousin is getting married so I'm looking for a place to stay in Milan from August 27th to September 1st :slightly_smiling_face: I'd be leaving from Punta Cana
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great :slightly_smiling_face: Ok, I have El Mundo Hotel available from August 27-31. It’s a four star hotel near the airport with free wifi and breakfast.
Customer: That could work! How much is it?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): 2488.66USD
Customer: Is that the price for 2 people?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Just one. Would you like to know the price for two adults?
Customer: yes that would be great! I'm going with my husband
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok :slightly_smiling_face: In that case I could book the two of you for 4977.33USD
Customer: That's a bit expensive! Do you have any cheaper deals?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I’m sorry, nothing available for two people at a lower price from Punta Cana to Milan :disappointed:
Customer: What about if we left earlier? Like the 25th?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I do have options available leaving on the 25th, however they are more expensive.
Customer: Ok, let me see them
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Let me know when you are ready to book :slightly_smiling_face:
Customer: My husband didn't want to come anyways and we can't afford to both go so I guess i'll book hotel for one person
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok, sure thing! I will take care of that for you
Customer: Thank you!
