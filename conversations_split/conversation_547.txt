Customer: THIS IS WHAT I NEED: TIX FOR 3 ADULTS FROM BERLIN TO SENDAI. LEAVING SEPT 2 OR SOMETIME CLOSE AFTER THAT. CAN I GET THIS DONE FOR &lt;$2400?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid that I only have one seat left on a flights between those cities.
Customer: WHAT?? HOW ABOUT BERLIN TO FRANKFURT
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can offer you an 8 day package leaving September 6th. The three of you would stay at Atlantis Peaks Resort which boasts 5 stars. I can even book you on business class tickets if you would like and the total cost would still be well below your budget.
Customer: THAT IS SUPERB PLEASE DO!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): So just to confirm you want me to book you for this 8 day package in Frankfurt with business class flights?
Customer: Yes yes and yes
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Perfect, it's booked!
Customer: :pray:
