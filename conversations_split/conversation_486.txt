Customer: Good morning! I'm an expat writer living in Kobe, Richard O'Brien, ever heard of me?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Are you looking for a destination from Tokyo?
Customer: Well I need that to change, which is why I need to book a trip to somewhere calm where I can finish my novel which will hopefully make me a world renowned author, not like my last book...So yes, to answer your question, I am looking for a trip from Kobe to maybe Munich. I am a real family man and will be travelling with my wife and our son, can't live without those two. 2 adults and 1 child
Customer Service Agent (CSA): when would you like to leave and return?
Customer: the sooner we could leave the better, but I don't have specific date constraints. I would like to be away for 7 days though
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a 6 day package available at our highest rated hotel in Munich departing Sept 6 and returning Sept 10. Does this interest you sir?
Customer: I'm not sure I can afford a highly rated hotel, our budget is 3600
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have no packages available in Munich for under $3600.00. I can check other destinations for you if you like, or I can check to see if there are shorter packages available.
Customer: I really need about 7 days to work.. How about if we went to Hamburg instead?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): At the present time, there are no flights available from Kobe to Hamburg.
Customer: Oh well, thank you for your help, I understand that our budget is quite limiting I will see if other agencies have cheaper trips we can affoord Cheers!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Have a pleasant day
