Customer: I would like to go on a trip with my wife and 2 kids. Our budget is 3700 and we'd like to go between august 27th and september 10th. I've been thinking about going to Curitiba from Paris
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have one option available for you. Unfortunately, it is slightly above your budget at 4961.26USD. However, it is an 11 day package. Would you like some more details on it?
Customer: yes I would like more details please
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We have the Muse available from August 27 to  Sept 6. It carries a 2 star rating but with a very high user rating of 8.98/10. It included free wifi throughout your stay.
Customer: how much is this package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): $4961.25USD based on you travelling on economy class.
Customer: I will have to reject this package, it is just too expensive. Maybe you could check flights to Seattle for me?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I do have several packages available in Seattle but all are higher than your budget, the least expensive costing 5301.23USD.
Customer: hm...how about Miami? I can increase my budget by $1000
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No need. In Miami, I have several packages available which fit your budget and date criteria. Would you prefer to be near the airport or the mall?
Customer: I think we'd rather be by the mall so my wife can shop!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Close to the mall and park, I have the 3 STAR Triple Aegis, with an option of 9 or 11 days. A 9 day stay will cost you  2435.97USD and an 11 day stay will cost you 2219.45USD. These are both also available on business class seats and still under your budget.
Customer: What are the dates for the cheaper package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Departing Aug 30th, returning Sept 6th
Customer: That sounds good to me. How much are business seats for this package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): 3122.50USD
Customer: not too shabby. I like this one and so does the wife, so we will go ahead and book this one please
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I will proceed with booking. Have a great day.
Customer: Thank you so much!
