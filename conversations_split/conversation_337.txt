Customer: How much would it cost for two? Can you do any honeymoon discounts?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): For two it would cost 2006.22USD.
Customer: Our budget is 1200, that won't work :disappointed: How much would a trip for two to San Diego cost?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Oh dear. Well Iâ€™m sorry but I have nothing available within your parameters. Are you flexible with any of your conditions?
Customer: I'm flexible with destination and length of trip. The only thing that is inflexible is budget

Customer: Okay will consider it and get back to you, thanks!
