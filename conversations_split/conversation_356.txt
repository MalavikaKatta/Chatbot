Customer: I'd like to book a trip for myself, from Tel Aviv to Tampa from, departing Aug 21, returning Aug 24. Do you have such a flight for me?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Iâ€™m sorry but I have no departures from Tel Aviv in my database. I can book you from Melbourne ?
Customer: Then you are useless to me. Good bye.
