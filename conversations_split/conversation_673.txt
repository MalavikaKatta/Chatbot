Customer: Soooo Iâ€™m wondering can I bring my wife and 3 kids to Kingston for 2800 dollars?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It will all depend on where you are leaving from. To confirm, that will be 2 adults and 3 kids?
Customer: Correct yes, and we will leave from Recife.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): From Recife to Kingston there is nothing available. Could I search other packages for you?
Customer: Ahhh ok, maybe try Phoenix. If perhaps the problem is my budget, lets just up it by another thousand dollars.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Did you have some dates in mind?
Customer: Yes, we have a wide stretch of possible vacation days from September 13th until October 3rd
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Travel packages are not available to Phoenix from Kingston for 2 adults and 3 children during those dates and for that budget. I regret I cannot make possible suggestions, but i can check other destinations for you.
Customer: Well what about in Goiania.?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Nothing, I apologize.
