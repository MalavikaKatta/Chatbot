Customer: Hi! I'd like to book a trip to Tel Aviv from Tijuana. I was wondering if there are any packages from August 23rd to 26th for $3400 for 2 adults. My dates are also flexible.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I apologize but I do not have any flights available from Tel Aviv to Tijuana. Would you like me to look for packages at other destinations?
Customer: What if i increase my budget by $300?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It will not make a difference as we do not fly from Tel Aviv to Tijuana.
Customer: Oh okay. well thanks anyway. I might come back later if i decide to go somewhere else.
