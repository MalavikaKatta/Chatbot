Customer: Hey, I'm looking to book my honeymoon from Houston to Santo Domingo for a week on August 26th. My budget is 1500.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I cannot offer you anything less expensive than 1932.27 USD. Is your budget flexible?
Customer: No. Is there anything in my budget from Houston to Cancun?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): And your budget is not flexible?
Customer: No I already spent too much on the wedding so my budget is fixed.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can offer you 5 days in Cancun at a 4 star hotel for 1474.18 USD.
Customer: I think that will work! What all does the hotel offer?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Everything that one needs: free breakfast, wifi and parking!
Customer: Great! Let's book it!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): A confirmation email will be sent to you shortly. Have a nice day!
Customer: Thanks!
