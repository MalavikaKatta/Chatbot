Customer: Hey how are you?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I am well, how may I help you today?
Customer: I want to go visit some relatives in Tampa, but they don't have room to host me so I am looking for a flight and hotel combo package. I would be free to travel between September 6th to 24th
Customer Service Agent (CSA): What is your city of departure?
Customer: I'm sorry I wrote that too fast, I meant to say that I am leaving FROM Tampa and visiting family in Munich
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have hotel stays in 5 day and 7 day lengths, which one do you prefer?
Customer: How much are they? My budget is 3600
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Both are available for under that amount. Anything special you would like for your hotel in Munich?
Customer: Not really, I won't be spending much time there so it doesn't have to be anything fancy. Can you tell me more about the 7 day stay?

Customer Service Agent (CSA): In Munich all the hotels that are open at the moment are 5 star rated hotels. This hotel is also available for 2157.43USD for 5 days from Sept 6 to Sept 9.
