Customer: I am just DYING to get to Madrid and check out this hot new food truck that serves llama meat tacos. I’m on a limited budget though.. so if you could get me there sometime in the next month or so for like 1100 bucks it would be AMAZING. Let’s try leaving from Las Vegas maybe?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Hello. We do not have flights from Las Vegas to Madrid. Can you depart from somewhere else?
Customer: Ahhh fine.. try leaving from Kyoto.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Neither
Customer: Ok well there’s a new boutique maple candy shop that just opened in Vancouver.. how much can I get there for from Las Vegas?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How long do you want to go to Vancouver for?

Customer Service Agent (CSA): 3 or 4 star hotel?
Customer: I can afford either?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): yes
