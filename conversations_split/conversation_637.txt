Customer: hey there
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Good morning!
Customer: I’m looking for a package to Leon
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Perfect, where would you like to leave from?
Customer: Pittsburgh. I need a luxurious package.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How many people will you be and do you have some travel dates in mind?
Customer: 1 adult i will leave sept first
and stay as long as I can for 3200
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We have a highly rated 5 star hotel available with a Sept 1st departure. Are you interested in hearing more about this property?
Customer: I’m intersted in hearing more.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Serene Palms Resort is a 5 star resort with a 8.98/10 guest rating located on the beach and near the palace. I meant to say  that it is within your budget of $3200 at 2342.94USD if you go on economy  or 2980.38USD if you go on business class for a nine day stay.
Customer: What else would be available there? I just wanna make sure I’m booking the best place...
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is indeed. One of our highest rated hotels in Leon. I also have the highly rated Hotel Sunny Aurora, also a 5 star property, but this one is not available before Sept 8.
Customer: Hmmmm I certainly hope its not booked up by the party who I’m tracking... I’ll just chance it and go with the Palms anyway. I’m sure 5 stars in Leon will find me some face of note
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Does the Sept 1st departure with a return date of Sept 9th work for you? Would you prefer to be booked into economy or business class?
Customer: Lets do business - maybe I’ll luck out sitting next to Madonna on the plane
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I will now proceed with the booking.  Thank you and have a wonderful day.
Customer: Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
