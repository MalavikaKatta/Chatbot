Customer: I have 0 budget. But big dreams
I’m heading out from Tampa
Going to Campinas
But I’m ok with any destination really
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid I cannot help you here.
Customer: Ok that was a stretch. Just trying to see if you would glitch and give me a freebie
But for real, where can I go with 400$?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Now that's better! I can take you to Punta Cana or Atlanta with that.
Customer: It would be nice to get out of the country! What hotel could you find me in Punta Cana?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You can have a 14 day trip to Punta Cana at a 2.5 star beachside hotel for 167.60 if you fly economy.
Customer: That is a bargain and a half. Does the hotel also serve free breakfast?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No, it is void of any amenities. But who needs those when you've got the beach?
Customer: WHY SEE THE WORLD, WHEN YOU’VE GOT THE BEACH?? you speak wise words
sign me up
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Your trip is booked for you
Customer: That is all, my friend
