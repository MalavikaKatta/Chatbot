Customer: Hi I wanna take a 12 day trip from Hiroshima to Phoenix, leaving on August 27th.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Will anyone be joining you?
Customer: No, I don't like other people.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Not a problem, and do you have a budget?
Customer: No, I'm rich.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Would an 8 day stay at a 3 star hotel for 4202.50USD, with economy flight leaving on August 27th interest you?
Customer: Possibly. Is there anything from Hiroshima to Baltimore?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Are your dates flexible? I cannot offer dates earlier than September 1st for a flight from Hiroshima to Baltimore.
Customer: No. That's okay. Is there anything for Boston instead of Baltimore?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): there's a 2.5 star hotel starting at 4162.73USD for 8 days with a departure flight leaving on August 27th, or a 3 star hotel starting at 4586.75USD for 8 days with a departure flight leaving on August 30th. Do either of these interest you?
Customer: no. I think ill take the trip to Phoenix. Does the hotel offer wifi?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes, the hotel offers breakfast, wifi and parking!
Customer: Great! I'll take it
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure thing! Your reservation has been completed.
Customer: thank you
