Customer: I am looking for a honeymoon package to Manaus. I heard it is the perfect honeymooners paradise. The wedding cost us an arm and a leg so I really need something reasonable.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): hmm okay let us figure something out! what is your budget? will it just be you and your significant other?
Customer: Yes and our set of twins. Won't be a very romantic honeymoon, but what can you do. We live in Queenstown.  I hope $3000 is enough!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): do you have any dates in mind?
Customer: We would like to leave on the 18th of August! We need to book this quick cause my boss is in the other room and if he catches me on the phone he'll have a fit.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It seems that we do not have anything to Manaus with that budget can you increase it? and we have dates of departure on August 19th and 25th
Customer: No there's no way this wedding has already cost me a fortune I don't even know why we got married, we already had the damn kids. How about Leon on the 18th?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): it is a 7 day stay at the Sunny Aurora Hotel, it is a 5 star hotel with free wifi, the flight leaves on the 18th and is a total of $2625
Customer: thanks! book it!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): perfect! enjoy your stay!
