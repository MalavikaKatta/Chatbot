Customer: Madonna and I need to get as far away from the paparazzi as humanly possible. We want to go to Paris from Toluca and I need to be back by September 11th because I am performing the next day.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have several options to offer you, do you have a budget in mind?
Customer: NO! of course not lol i'm rich AF
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In that case, the best package we have for you is a 13 day holiday at the Hotel Blueberry. It is a 4 star hotel and you would be flying in business class. You would leave August 25th and return to Tolucca on September 5th.
