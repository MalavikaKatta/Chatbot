Customer: Everyone in Europe is raving about this artisanal bratwurst they’re serving up in Hamburg, and I must get myself other there as soon as I can to blog about it! Do you offer flights there out of Seattle?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I sure do! When do you want to travel?
Customer: ASAP, but otherwise dates are flexible
budget is 3800
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great! I have a package leaving on August 31 until September 11. The cost is 2157 dollars
Customer: Oh nice I’m just going to check my other travel options for something cheaper
such as…Santos to Hamburg?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): There is nothing cheaper.
Customer: Now if I really wanted to pinch pennies, I could also just travel to St. Louis instead
Customer Service Agent (CSA): From Santos?
Customer: From Seattle
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You could go from August 31st to September 16th for $532, at a 5 star hotel!
Customer: That is dirt cheap! I could just splurge on my meals instead. What kind of hotel do you have?
As in, tell me more about the 5 star
Customer Service Agent (CSA): 5 stars, as I said.
Customer: Amenities?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Free breakfast and free wifi are included.
Customer: Ok lets do that
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! I’ll book it for you.
Customer: Thanks!
