Customer Service Agent (CSA): Are your dates flexible?
Customer: Yes my dates are quite flexible
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Actually, on further inspection I have found a 4 star hotel available from Sept 2-6 for you! You would stay at the Hotel Grand Residence - a 8.8 user rated hotel with free breakfast and wifi. The total price for this package is $2917.
Customer: Is there a business flight for this package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): There sure is! The cost to upgrade to business class would bring your total to 3794.31USD

Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is near shopping and a cathedral
Customer: OOOOOO SHOPPING!!! I'll take it! Sign me up!
