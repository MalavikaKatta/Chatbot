Customer: i want to leave Pittsburgh. for 9 days
and spend 0 dollars
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry, but that is not possible. Is your budget flexible by any chance?
Customer: I can scrounge up 400 I guess if I raid my mom's couch cushions
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I could work wth that. When do you want to leave?
Customer: whenever dude
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I only have 8 day or 10 day trips. Would you like to hear more about the available destinations?
Customer: yeah just tell me where I can go
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You can go to Atlanta for 10 days. Or you can go to Denver or Calgary for 8 days.
Customer: what is the Atlanta hotel like?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It's a 3.5 star beachside hotel that's also close to a park. It offers guests parking and wifi free of charge.
Customer: that's pretty sweet.. how much would the 10 day package be?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It would fit right under your budget at 385.50.
Customer: dope. are the hotels in Calgary or Denver nicer tho?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): There are no nicer hotels in Denver, but Calgary's different. It's a 4.0 star hotel next to a university and it offers the same amenities as the Atlanta hotel.
Customer: i'd rather be at a beach than a school...can I afford to fly business class to Atlanta
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No.
Customer: fine book that one but economy class.. i'm just stoked to be staying on the beach for under 400
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sounds good. I will sign you up for it! Email confirmation is coming your way.
Customer: thanks bud
