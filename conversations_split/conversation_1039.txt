Customer: Hi. I'm just here at work.... stuck at the old computer desk
Stuck dreaming about a better place than this one
I have been wanting to get out of Santa Cruz for ages now
But I never have any vacation days..
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Okay, where would you want to go?
Customer: I really wanna go to Minneapolis
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Would you have a budget?
Customer: Yeah.. I have 3100 in my savings account.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately there are no results for this within your budget. Do you have a second destination you were wondering about?
Customer: Would I able to get to Kobe maybe?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Again, not within your budget.
Customer: Hiroshima???
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Nothing available within your budget, sadly.
