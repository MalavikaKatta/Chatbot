Customer: Hey, I need a break from work, a break from SL
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'd be happy to help you find the perfect getaway. Where would you like to go?
Customer: iâ€™d be leaving from indianapolis thinking about going to Fortaleza september 2 until the tenth
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have two trips that fit your exact dates. Both are 3 star hotels. One of them has a guest rating of 7.15/10 while the other has a guest rating of 9.32/10. Do you have any questions about these two?
Customer: Oh, yes tell me more about the 9.32 guest rating hotel!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is conveniently located close to a park and a museum. While there, you enjoy wifi, breakfast, and parking free of charge. Flying business will cost you 3767.4, and flying economy will cost you 2956.73.
Customer: can you tell me whats available in Queenstown from Indianapolis - same dates?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately we don't offer any trips from Fortaleza to Queenstown that fit within your dates. Can you make your dates flexible?
Customer: In Fortaleza, is the 7.15 guest rating hotel on the beach by any chance?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): there is no nearby beach... but it is close to a mall!
Customer: well in that case I think we should go with the higher rated option
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure! Do you want to go with business for 3767.4 or economy for 2956.73?
Customer: i think ill splurge for business!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sounds good! I will confirm the reservation for you. Have a good vacation!
Customer: thank you , i need it :smile:
