Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok, leaving on the 17th I have two hotel options - both are 3.0 stars with free parking, wifi, and breakfast.
Customer: what are the price differences?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Would you like to compare the packages with economy or business class flights?
Customer: yes please, is there a different price between hotels?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The first hotel would be 877.94USD with economy class flights and 1082.29USD with business class. The second hotel package costs 938.26USD with economy class flights and 1142.61USD for business class.
