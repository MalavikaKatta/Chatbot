Customer: Hi there, my friends and I would like to go to Belo Horizonte from Tofino for a couple days please.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I canâ€™t offer anything out of Tofino unfortunately. Is there an alternate departure city I could try for you?
Customer: But all 9 of us will be coming from there!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Can I look into something else for you?
Customer: No thank you.
