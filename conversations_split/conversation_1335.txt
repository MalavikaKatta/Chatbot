Customer: My friends and I would like to go Belo Horizonte please.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How many will you be total? And where are you coming from?
Customer: We'll be 10 people coming from Guadalajara. If you could find us something really cheap, that would be great!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have a specific budget in mind?
Customer: yeah, 1800 dollars.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry, we actually don't have any current openings in trips to Belo Horizonte. Is there somewhere else you would like to go?
Customer: What? Seriously? That can't be possible. Can you double-check?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately there is nothing for Belo Horizonte right now.
Customer: Aw that's a shame. A lot of people will be disappointed. Thanks anyways.
