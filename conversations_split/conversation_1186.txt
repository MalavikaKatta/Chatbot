Customer: I have business in Belem… business that requires me to be in close proximity to 5-star hotel type clients. I’m leaving from Vitoria, 3200 dollar
budget
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ah I see. Do you have departure and return dates in mind? And how long would you like to go for?
Customer: I just need to be there after the 21st. I can stay as long as my budget allows
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Not a problem! Our most highly rated hotel is a 4.5 star for 6 days, and business class would cost you 3046.43, fitting you right with the budget! Does this interest you?
Customer: That might be good — sounds diva worthy. is there a spa on site?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we don't have any hotels that offer spas but there is a beach!
Customer: That should be fine…. I think I’ll find who I’m looking for
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Excellent. I'll book it straight away then!
Customer: Downgrade to economy class though please
I don’t need to fly business
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I will switch to economy seats
Customer: I can use that extra money on a wide angle lens. thanks
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You're welcome. Expect an email with all the details within the next hour.
