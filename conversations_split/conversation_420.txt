Customer: I want to dream of a better life and pretend I have money and vacation days left. Can you check packages from Queenstown to LA?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): What's your budget?
Customer: yeah try $4000, that's all I have in my bank account anyway.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! You could spend 11 days at Snooze Inn & Suites, located near the university with a 3.0 star rating and free wifi, parking, and breakfast. Alternatively, the 3.0 star Secret Ribbon Inn would be available within your price parameters for a stay of up to 16 days. The Retro Inn is located near a park and university and features free wifi and parking with a breakfast included in your package.
Customer: Any flights to Atlanta?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I've got 19 days on the beach, located near a park, the Summer Covert Club would cost only 2986.76USD with business class flights!
Customer: wow.....you're making me wish I hadn't spent my vacation days self-loathing and getting plastered. Are there any trips to Fukuoka?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Of course! In Fukuoka you could have your pick of the Apex Hotel, Oceanside Hotel, Historic Mansion Hotel, or the Hotel Sugoi for under 4000 dollars. All with free wifi. 
Customer: wow.... well if i could travel at this time I would take the Atlanta trip but maybe next year.... Thanks for enlightening me today
