Customer: That is marvellous news! I have 3800 saved up, will that last us the entire trip?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Well, the cheapest option I have available for you is just a bit beyond your budget - $4198.89
Customer: Oh dear What if I wanted to take the young'uns to Denver instead?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I’m sorry, but the only hotel I have available in Denver for your party costs more than the cheapest Tijuana package.
Customer: Rats. I could take the kids to Los Angeles
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You’re in luck! I have on package available for your price point. The hotel is 3.0 stars, near the airport and a mall, has a guest rating of 8.86/10, has free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking!
