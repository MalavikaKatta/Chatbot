Customer: Hi, do you have flights out of Tel Aviv?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): For one person? Any travel dates in mind?
Customer: Nope, I wish! I will be dragging 4 other adults with me. No set dates specifically..
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It seems we have no flights out of Tel Aviv. Can I search other departure cities for you?
Customer: Darn it, okay I can also leave from Beijing
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm not showing any results out of Beijing either,
Customer: That is very unfortunate. Thanks for your help though!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You are welcome
