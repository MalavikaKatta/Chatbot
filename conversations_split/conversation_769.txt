Customer: ok the dreamer is back at it. this time i'd like to hear about trips leaving denver
such as mexico city?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Denver to Mexico City... for one?
Customer: yup
Customer Service Agent (CSA): For as long as possible?
Customer: for whatever 5400 can buy me
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Does 11 days on a beach at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites sound like something you are dreaming of?
Customer: Its as if you can read my mind! How many stars they have?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It has 3.5 stars and is also close to shopping.
Customer: And the amenities?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): free parking should you require a car and free wifi
Customer: cool. what are my options to rio de janeiro
Customer Service Agent (CSA): My best hotel in Rio de Janeiro is the La Perfecci√≥n for an 8 day stay, 3 star, breakfast is included and you have a parking spot and wifi at no charge.
Customer: Could I find anything like it in Ulsan?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have 5 star hotels in Ulsan, but none of them include all of the amenities.
Customer: Thats fine
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Then I can offer you the 5 STAR The Sapphire Time close to the park, market and theatre, this seems to be the most expensive hotel in Ulsan and is available for 10 days at  4277.25USD. For this one you would have to fly economy though. If you wanted to stay five days only but fly business, we could do that too for just a bit more money.
Customer: Ahh there it is. Thats all I needed today, thanks
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Come again!
