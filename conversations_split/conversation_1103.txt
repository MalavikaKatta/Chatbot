Customer: Katniss here, im in Rio de Janeiro and need to get to Paris to shoot a film
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately we don't offer trips from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Do you have somewhere else you'd like to go?
Customer: I guess i can go to hamburg instead and chill with Selena
Customer Service Agent (CSA): That I can help with! How does an 11 day stay at a 4.5 star hotel near the airport sound?
Customer: Sounds good enough. Out of curiosity, is there a 5 star hotel?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Not that I can find... the 4.5 star one is the best in Hamburg.
Customer: Okay, iâ€™ll take it, thank you and peace out!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great! It is booked for you. Have a great trip!
