Customer: Amenities?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Free wifi and breakfast is included.
Customer: Moving on - can you  tell me your best hotel in Detroit?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In Detroit our only availability is a 2.5 star hotel.
Customer: Ah, that won't do at all. Anything nicer in Kingston?
