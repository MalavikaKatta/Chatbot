Customer: hayyyy so I just got married :smile: we totally forgot about booking our honeymoon. But yeah, the two of us wanna go to Fortaleza. the wedding is in Tijuana, and we wanna go on august 27
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a 5 day vacation at the Secret Prairie Resort to offer you. It would cost 3097.70USD if you took economy flights or 3916.95USD if you flew in business class. Does this fit in your budget?
Customer: omg that is actually perfect - our budget is 3100! and what are the details?? whats the place like??
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is a 3 star hotel close to a park and shopping and it includes free breakfast, wifi and parking. It has a great user review of 8.22/10 so it should meet all your expectations!
Customer: ok that sounds pretty good actually!! i mean id prefer better than 3 stars for our honeymoon and all but if its got a guest rating of 8.22 stars then thats good. and what at the flight dates?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The trip would be from August 27th as requested to August 31st.
Customer: lets book!
