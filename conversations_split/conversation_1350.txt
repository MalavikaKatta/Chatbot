Customer: I'm good, thanks. I have an important business meeting in San Juan.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): When do you need to get there? And where are you from?
Customer: Anytime soon would be good. I'll be flying from Buenos Aires.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How does an 11 day stay at a 4 star hotel sound? This trip runs from Sept 14 - 24
Customer: That sounds really good, but how much does it cost?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): With economy flights it would be 2774.28, and with business flights it would be 3583.43.
Customer: That's even better than I expected. Sounds like a fantastic deal. I will take it, and at business class please.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Done! Your trip is booked for you! Watch out for the confirmation email coming your way!
Customer: Thank you very much.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Not a problem! Have a good trip!
