Customer Service Agent (CSA): You could stay for 10 days at the Oceanside Hotel for 6371.69USD.
Customer: is that a good hotel?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It depends what you are looking for. This one has 3.5 stars and is located in the heart of the city.
Customer: that is not a good hotel...is there a better one?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We do not have hotels with more than 3.5 stars in Fukuoka
