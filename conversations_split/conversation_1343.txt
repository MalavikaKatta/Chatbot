Customer: My friends and I would love to get to Phoenix please!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where will you be coming from? And how many friends?
Customer: It'll be 3 of us from Tofino.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry, we currently don't have any trips leaving from Tofino. Any chance you can leave from another city?
Customer: Oh really? I guess we can leave from Beijing then.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately we also don't serve trips out of Beijing. Would you have another alternative?
Customer: We can leave from Beijing though, right?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately no. We don't serve flights out of Beijing. Would you be able to leave from somewhere else?
Customer: I guess I'll have to go elsewhere to book our trip
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry I was not able to help!
Customer: That's fine, we'll look somewhere else. Bye.
