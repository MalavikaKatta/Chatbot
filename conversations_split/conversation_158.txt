Customer: Hello!!!!! We are planning a family trip with my brother and his kids and we are thinking Gotham City would be super cool for the kids. Do you have any packages for less than $3200?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Gotham city does not have any packages with us. Are you willing to travel somewhere else? If so, where are you departing from and how many people will be in this party?
Customer: We all live in Termina. Anywhere else fun we could take the kids? Do you have anything to Disneyland? We are 5 adults and 11 kids.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I dont think we have anything to disneylandâ€¦ may you tell me what dates you are willing to travel
Customer: We don't really have any set dates, sometime this summer would be great. If Disneyland is not available either, do you have any suggestions for us? Whatever you have that we can get to from Termina.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): there seems to be nothing coming out of termina, would you be able to depart from anywhere else?
Customer: Not really. What if I increase my budget to $4200.00, can you offer us anything from Termina then?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I apologize it seems there are no flights leaving from termina
Customer: I will call around then and see if I can get a deal out of Termina somewhere else. Thank you for your help anyway,
