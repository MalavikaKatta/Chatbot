Customer: San Jose. My budget is 20900 too and we have no specific date for return
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I also need to confirm return date as in your original statement you said it was Sept 2nd
Customer: yeah thats correct, I'm getting my plans all mixed up today. We would like to return on the 2nd
Customer Service Agent (CSA): do you have specific destinations you would like me to verify?
