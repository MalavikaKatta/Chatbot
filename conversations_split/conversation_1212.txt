Customer: Guess what? I'm a recently married person looking for a honeymoon package from osaka to manaus!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Manaus sounds like an excellent choice! Do you have a budget in mind?
Customer: yeah we have 6300 dollars left over after the wedding
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we do not have any packages to offer you at that price. Is there any chance you can stretch your budget?
Customer: its all we have... can it get us to burlington instead?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Not at that price, I'm afraid. Sorry.
