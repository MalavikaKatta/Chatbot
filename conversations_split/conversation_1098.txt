Customer: Hi! I have 6 days vacation and I don’t know where i’d like to go, was hoping you could help.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Happy to help! Which dates are your vacation and where are you coming from?
Customer: I can leave on or after Monday and i would need to leave from Rosario
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Is there a budget you'd like me to work with?
Customer: nope!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Okay, we offer 6 day trips starting on Monday to Maceio, St. Louis, and New York. If none of these destinations interest you, we have a few other destinations with 5 day trips.
Customer: I’d like to look at just the 6 day trips and if i dont find anything i like we can look at the 5 day trips. Whats the best you have in Maceio?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It would be a 3.5 star hotel close to the park and shopping with 8.37/10 guest ratings.
Customer: not too shabby, anything to St. Louis?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In SL we have a 3.0 star beachside hotel with 7.15/10 guest ratings.
Customer: That’s the best in SL?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It's the best that works with your vacation dates.
Customer: Okay, um let’s hear what ya got for New York.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We've got a 2.5 star hotel near the museum and airport. It has a guest rating of 8.22/10.
Customer: no way. Do you have any 5 star hotels anywhere?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No
Customer: Well can i hear them anyway, I might be willing to work something out if i find a package that’s worth it.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We actually don't have 5 star hotels available for any trips 6 days or under leaving from Rosario. Would you be able to make your dates flexible or leave from another city?
Customer: No. You know what, it’s fine, I’ll just look somewhere else or take my vacations days another time if i cant find a trip. Thanks anyway.
