Customer: Hi there, I'm looking for a place to get away with my best friend. Do you think you can give an amazing package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure! Where are you looking to go? And can you tell me where you’d be departing from?
Customer: We're leaving from Tofino and we're thinking of going to Santos.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry, no can do. I don’t offer any trips to or from Tofino.
Customer: Oh really? Don't you know who I am?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I cannot book trips out of Tofino.
Customer: Fine, if you're going to be like that... I guess we can leave from Frankfurt.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a variety of 3 and 3.5 star hotel in Santos for you. When would you like to travel?
Customer: Is 3.5 stars the best you can do? Are you serious? How about if we go to St. Louis then
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In St. Louis I also have 3 and 3.5 star hotels.
Customer: What's the most highly guest-rated hotel you have?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Palacio Tranquila in St. Louis has 9.16/10 from users.
Customer: What more can you tell me about this package
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The hotel is near an airport and a theatre, it provides free parking and wifi, and complimentary breakfast is included.
Customer: How much is it? And does it come before September 12th? Because that's when I need to get back in order to perform.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): 3662.78USD with economy class flights. You would depart Frankfurt on Sept 16th and return on the 25th.
Customer: okay, I'm talking business class here. Do I look like an economy class type of person to you? What do you take me for?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): A business class package would cost 4709.76USD.
Customer: Cut the attitude and stop treating me like a second-class citizen. I'll take this package but that's the last time I'm ever going to use your services
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I will send along booking confirmation. Thank you for using!
