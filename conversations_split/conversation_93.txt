Customer: Hello, I'd like to book a trip to Mos Eisley from Hogsmeade on August 13.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Hello, the origin and destination do not show up in our system. Are there any other destinations you are interested in?  When will you be travelling?
Customer: I'd consider travelling to Coruscant with 12 adults on a budget of $2900, leaving on August 13 from Hogsmeade.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I apologize, but I cannot accommodate this request either.
Customer: That is very unfortunate. Thank you.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Thank you and sorry we let you down.
