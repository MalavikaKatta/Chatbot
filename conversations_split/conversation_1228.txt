Customer: Hi! I have 4 children and I would like to take them to Santa Cruz to visit their mom. We are in Monterrey.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): So will it just be 1 adult and 4 children then?  Do you have a budget in mind?
Customer: Correct. And no budget, Iâ€™m willing to spend whatever for my kids to see their mum
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have any dates in mind? And how long do you plan on travelling for?
Customer: Nope! Whatever is available. We arent picky
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we don't have any packages available from Monterrey to Santa Cruz. Would you like to leave from another city?
Customer: I cant leave from anywhere else but we can go to San Juan instead.

Customer: Is there anything shorter?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes, we have a 6 day economy package  that comes to a total of 4987, does that interest you?
Customer: Is that the shortest package?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes indeed. Would you like to book it?
