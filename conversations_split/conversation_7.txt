Customer: I'm looking for a trip to Gotham City leaving from Kakariko Village on Saturday, August 13, 2016. 3 adults for no more than $2400 USD.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a trip available to Vancouver for these dates within your price range.  Would you like to increase your budget or adjust the dates?
Customer: I'd like to adjust the departure city to Caprica.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Still no availability for this destination.  Would you like to increase your budget or adjust the dates?
Customer: The dates cannot be changed. How about going to Theed with 14 adults, leaving from Kakariko Village, on a budget of $2900?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Still no availability.
Customer: Then I will bring my business elsewhere. Thank you.
