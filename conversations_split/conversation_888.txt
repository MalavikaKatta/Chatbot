Customer: My place just burnt down and I need to get home immediately!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I am very sorry to hear that. Where are you leaving from? Where would you like to go?
Customer: I've been backpacking around the world for 3 months and now I'm in Vitoria.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where do you need to get to?
Customer: Mexico City. I need to leave on or after September 16.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): ok! Have you got a travel budget?
Customer: I got $3000 left to my name, that's why it's crucial I get home and deal with the insurance company!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The only result I’m getting is a 15 day package to Mexico City for 2504.13USD. You would leave on September 20th. Is that ok?
Customer: I guess that would work. Nothing sooner?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry - that’s the best I can do.
Customer: What if I leave from Rio de Janeiro instead?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The soonest I can get you out of Rio de Janeiro is also the 20th of September.
Customer: What if I leave from Vitoria and go to Cancun instead?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Once again, I have trips only on September 20th.
Customer: And from Rio de Janeiro to Cancun?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): September 20th or 21st.
Customer: The original 15 day package to Mexico City, what hotel is it at?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Hotel Tropic, a 3 star hotel on the beach.
Customer: Well I guess I'll  take it, the insurance should reimburse me and 15 days gives me enough time to find another home.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I’ll go ahead and book that for you :slightly_smiling_face:
Customer: Thank you!
