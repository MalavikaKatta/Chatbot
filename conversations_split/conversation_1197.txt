Customer: My lover and I just got married - like TODAY And we wanna fly off to Brazil for a week or so. Can you get us to Buenos Aires from Toronto for just under 5000 ?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I am afraid we have nothing within your budget of 5000. Is your budget flexible by any chance?
Customer: Nope, not at all. We’d settle for Chicago though. Anything there?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes there is! We have 6, 9, and 10 day packages. Do you have any preferences in terms of the number of days or anything else?
Customer: Are they all under $4800 ?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes
Customer: Great! Tell me about the 6 and 9 day packages.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): All the hotels are 2.5 stars. The 9 day package has a hotel closer to the city whereas there are two 6 day packages with one hotel closer to the city and the other hotel closer to the airport. What sounds good to you?
Customer: 9 days in the city would be nice. Amenities ? Also, please tell me the guest rating is 3.5higher than 2.10 ...
