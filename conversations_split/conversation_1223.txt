Customer Service Agent (CSA): Okay but where are you guys from?
Customer: San Juan. I have lived here for 45 years I moved there after I married his grandfather, he's passed now, he was a good man, I really miss him. My grandson is the light of my life now, his mama works too much.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We have an 11 day package at a 4 star hotel, with a park nearby.  It costs 1698.75 for an economy flight and 2022.80 for business. Would you be interested?
Customer: Do you think my grandson would like that?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You would love the park and the free wifi. And flying is always fun!
Customer: What about La Paz. Is there anything fun for him to do in La Paz?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Why yes! We have a lovely 7 day package at a 4 star hotel with free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi, all coming to a total of 2527.89 for economy and 3138.47 for business class. Does this entice you?
Customer: We can only leave after Sept 11 and we need to be back before the start of school on Sept 25th. Do both these packages suit the dates?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid only the La Paz one does. Would you like to book?
Customer: I guess if only La Paz suits the dates then La Paz it is. Yes please go ahead and book and take care sweetie.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Consider it booked! Enjoy your trip with your grandson.
Customer: Thank you kindly
