Customer: Barcelona is calling me. Please show me the way there from Belo Horizonte.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How much are you willing to spend?
Customer: Money is just a number. It doesn't really matter to me.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Is it just you?
Customer: Well... I'm actually booking for a colleague in the end.... but yes it'll just be one adult.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How long for?
Customer: I'm free Sept 17-30
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can recommend a 13 day trip that will cost you 3333.60 for business class, how does that sound?
Customer: What is the hotel like?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It's a 3 star hotel with a 9.16/10 guest rating with wifi and parking included. It's also in the heart of the city and it happens to be near a park and a university. Does that not sound appealing?
Customer: Do you have a higher star level hotel in Barcelona?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid 3 star hotels are the best we can do at the moment. Would you like to explore other options?
Customer: Yes... San Antonio also sounds nice
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm afraid we do not have any San Antonio packages that work. Are there other options that you would like to explore?
Customer: I could also leave from Mannheim!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Would you like me to search from Mannheim to San Antonio?
Customer: Yes please!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I'm sorry. We don't have any such packages that work. Would you like to explore other options?
Customer: Could you check if you can find a better package in Barcelona than the previous one if I depart from Mannheim?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We have only 3 star hotels in Barcelona no matter where you leave from.
Customer: I will take the 13 day trip then!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Business or economy?
Customer: Hmmm I want to go for business.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Consider it done!
Customer: Gracias!
