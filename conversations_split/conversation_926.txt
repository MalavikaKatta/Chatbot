Customer: Hi there
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Hello, ready to discover your perfect trip?
Customer: I have 6500 to spend on my parents. Want to get them out of Santo Domingo
Tomorrow to the 19th
Any destinations offer such a possibility
Customer Service Agent (CSA): My best package is a 16 day stay at a 5 star Berlin hotel. It's rated 8.86/10 and offers free wifi and breakfast.
Customer: That isâ€¦amazing. This is for two adults and under 6500?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yup, it will only be 6276.61 if they can fly economy.
Customer: I was going to review my options But I will be impulsive and seize this opportunity
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I think that's a very smart choice. Would you like me to confirm the booking for you?
