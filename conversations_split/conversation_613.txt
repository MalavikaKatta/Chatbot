Customer: Hi! My wife told me to look up some possible vacations
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where would you like to go and where are you leaving from?
Customer: We live in Dublin. Going to Sacramento
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How many adults and children will be travelling?
Customer: 2 adults, 1 child
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have a budget?
Customer: 2100
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you know when you'd like to leave?
Customer: Yes, we'd like to have our vacation be sometime in the first two weeks of September
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We have a business flight from September 1st to 12th. This is at a 2 star hotel near a park, museum, and university. The hotel has a 6.51/10 guest rating and offers free breakfast, wifi, and parking. This package will cost 1866.90.
Customer: Ok that sounds appealing aside from the 2 star hotel. Don't think Martha will be okay with a 2 star hotel
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is the only options for this destination. Want me to check another destination?
Customer: Our next city of interest is Hamburg
Customer Service Agent (CSA): There are no results for Hamburg. Would you like me to check another destination?
Customer: Oh dear. Please check Punta Cana
Customer Service Agent (CSA): There are no results for this either.
Customer: Would different results appear if I increased our budget by $1000?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): There are no results even with the increased budget.
Customer: My wife is going to make me sleep on the couch for this.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Apologies.
