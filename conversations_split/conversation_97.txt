Customer: Hello, I'd like to go to Birmingham for 7 days on my honeymoon, leaving from Denver on August 18. What can you offer?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I don't have any packages available in Birmingham, but I do have other options travelling out of Denver. 
Customer: Great. Is Phoenix in the list of other options?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Actually, I just found something available in Birmingham but it is only available on August 30th. Do you want more details on it?
Customer: Yes I would please!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It is a 7 day package at the The Emerald, a 4 star hotel with free wifi. The price on this package is $1242.7USD.
Customer: This sounds like a great package, although I would like to compare it to a trip to Phoenix. What is available?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have 2.5 star and 3 star packages available in Phoenix from August 27 to September 1st.  I have both economy and business class seats left.
Customer: Is there anything closer to the 18th of August to Phoenix?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No there is not, those packages are sold out.
Customer: What is the price of the 3 star hotel in Phoenix from August 27 to September 1st?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The Recreation Inn, a 3 star property, is $1832.8USD based on an economy class ticket. If you want a business class ticket, the price is $1832.8USD.
Customer: And what is the price of the 2.5 star hotel?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Economy or business?
Customer: Economy. I am trying to stay within a budget of $1000.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): It's a bit higher than your budget at $1849.57USD.  The trip to Birmingham was $1242.70USD so that was closer to your budget and that is in a 4 star property.
Customer: Is there anything available in Birmingham cheaper than $1242.70?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No but I have deals out of Denver  available on August 24th to Toronto and August 27 to Calgary for under $1000.
Customer: These are not destinations that I would like to go to. Thank you very much for your time, but, goodbye.
