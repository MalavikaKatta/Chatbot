Customer: I have a number of potential destinations. Trying to narrow them down a little
So we are departing from Pittsburgh
There are 9 of us: 2 adults and 7 children
With 9400, can we get to Chicago?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure can! The best hotels we have in Chicago are 2.5 stars, and you can stay up to 9 days. When would you like to go there?
Customer: The time frame would be Sept 8 to 20
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In this case, we have a 6 day vacation for you at a 2.5 star hotel near a museum and a university.
Customer: Thats doable. Can you also look up Fort Lauderdale?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In Fort Lauderdale we can only offer you a 2 star hotel near a market but you can stay 11 days.
Customer: Perfect. I didn’t even think we had much of a choice with our low budget, but I’m pleasantly surprised
I’m going to push my luck a little more
Can you check Belem?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry I think you just ran out of luck. Nothing in Belem. Is there another destination you would like me to help you check?
Customer: I’d like to know more about Fort Lauderdale. Specifically, the dates and prices
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The Fort Lauderdale hotel has been rated 8.22/10 by guests and offers free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The package is from Sept 8-18, economy is available for 5512.8 and business is 6518.86.
Customer: That one is good enough
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great! Would you prefer the economy or business package?
Customer: economy please!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure thing, I will book the economy for you. You should receive email confirmation shortly!
Customer: Thank you so much
