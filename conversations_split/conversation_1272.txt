Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok - I have two different hotels. Both are 3 stars, one is near a park with a 8.86/10 guest rating. The other is near nothing of note and has a 8.69/10 guest rating. The first hotel offers a package from September 13th-18th while the second is available from the 15th to the 20th.
Customer: The one with 8.86/10 guest rating is better.  Do you have anything in San Antonio?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have two hotels from the 12th to the 19th. Both are 2 stars, one has 7.15/10 user rating and the other has 4.74/10 from guests. Both are near parks and malls while the higher rated one from guests is also near a museum; the lower guest rated hotel is near a theatre as well. Both include free parking, free wifi, and free breakfast with their packages.
