Customer: Two tickets from Toronto to Dublin please!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Hello! for when?
Customer: August 30 or after please, flexible on the return date
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have nothing to Dublin! We do have many other destinations to choose from as we offer packages in all over the world. Can I interest you in a different destination?
Customer: Very well, could you try Miami then?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I regret that Miami is not one of the destinations we offer from Toronto. Are there others?
Customer: No there are not...time to write up a scathing review of this service.
