Customer: I need to book a trip for the whole family from Tampa but we don't know where to go. Can you help us?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure! How many are you and what's your budget?
Customer: 5 adults and 7 kids! Yup, the lot of us. We want to spend no more than 32800.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Do you have any date constraints?
Customer: Oh yes! Between September 12 and 26!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): In that case, I would like to recommend you our best deal: a 15 day stay at a prestigious 4 star hotel in Queenstown with free breakfast, wifi, and parking during your entire stay. For the whole family it will just be 31122.0.
Customer: That sounds amazing, and it's within those dates? Is that economy class?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yup it's from the 12th to the 25th, and it will be economy class.
Customer: Ok perfect, book me!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Consider it done! Have a good trip :slightly_smiling_face:
Customer: Thanks!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): My pleasure!
