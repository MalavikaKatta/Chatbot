Customer Service Agent (CSA): Tell me where you're coming from and where you would like to go :slightly_smiling_face:
Customer: Okay. I am in Fukuoka and I really have to go to Osaka.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Will it be just you? And are you travelling on a budget?
Customer: Just me. $1200. I heard Osaka is really nice. Can I leave on September 20 please?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I have a 4 day package to Osaka leaving on September 20. It's involves a 3 star hotel and it costs 523.92 for business class and 474.62 for economy. Would you be interested in this package at all?
Customer: What is the exact return date and can you tell me where the hotel is located?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): The return date is Friday September 23rd and it's a hotel with a 6.61 out of 10 rating, located near a museum. Are you interested in booking this?
