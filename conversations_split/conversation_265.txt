Customer: Hi! We are getting married in beautiful Cleveland underneath the redwoods next weekend. We've been soooooo busy we forgot about the honeymoon! Do you have any last minute special to Porto?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Yes, I do! What dates would you like to travel? Do you have a budget? Will there be just two of you travelling for your honeymoon?
Customer: The wedding is on the 23rd so it has the be the 24th or after. We are hoping for a week in Porto. We finally get some time, just the 2 of us!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): ok, great! I have 4 different hotels you can stay at. Would you like to hear about the 4.0 star hotel first?
Customer: Yes, it's our honeymoon after all! But we only have $5100 to spend.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately I have nothing available within your budget :disappointed:
Customer: how about a lower end hotel then :disappointed:
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sadly the cheapest in Porto for your dates is around 7000. Anywhere else I could look into for you?
Customer: No we can only go to Porto... or Porto. Thanks.
