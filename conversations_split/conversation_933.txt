Customer Service Agent (CSA): My best offer for leaving on Sep 6 is at a 2.5 star hotel for 6 days until Sep 10. Would you like to know more about this hotel?
Customer: I'm sorry, did I say the 6th? I meant the 8th. We need to leave on or after the 8th!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): No problem, for departure on the 8th, I have a 6 day package at a 3 star hotel, rated 8.86/10, with free wifi, breakfast, and parking.
Customer: How much for this one on economy? Can you check Kobe too please? I'll have to pick one, hope it's the right one!

Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sure! I'll book the San Diego trip for your group! Anything else I can do for you today?
