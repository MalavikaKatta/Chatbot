Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where are you coming from and how big is the family?
Customer: It would be 4 adults and 1 child. We'll be coming from Hiroshima.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Before I give you my recommendations, is there a budget you'd like me to stay under?
Customer: 4400 is our goal budget. Can you find something good for us?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): We have a fantastic 4.5 star hotel: the Ivory Legacy Hotel. I can take your family there for 7 days in business class with your budget.
