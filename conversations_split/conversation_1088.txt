Customer: Hey there, I need to book a trip to get away!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok! Where?
Customer: I'm thinking about taking my family to Denver.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): How many of you would be travelling?
Customer: I'll just be me, my wife, and our son.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok. Where are you leaving from?
Customer: Fukuoka.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): And have you got a travel budget?
Customer: I don't want to spend any more than 4900.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Unfortunately I cannot get you all to Denver for that price. Any other destinations to explore?
Customer: Oh that's too bad. My son was looking forward to it.
But yeah we can try somewhere else.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Where?
Customer: How about Nagoya?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): I can do that. I have the 3 star Oceanside Resort available for 9 days from September 12th to 20th. You would be staying near a university and have access to free parking, complimentary breakfast, and unlimited wifi usage. The total for your family of 3 would be 1554.40 USD.
Customer: Do you happen to have any six day packages?
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Sorry, this is the only package I have for Nagoya.
Customer: You know what, I'll take it. It's within my budget after all.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Great! I can upgrade you to business class flights at a total cost of 1723.51USD if you would like.
Customer: Thanks for the offer, but I don't really need it. I'm good with economy class!
Customer Service Agent (CSA): Ok, I will proceed with the economy class booking.
Customer: Excellent, thank you.
Customer Service Agent (CSA): You are oh so very welcome
