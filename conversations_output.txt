Turn: Hi! I'm getting married and we are super tight on money but I want to be able to give my new bride the best possible honeymoon despite our tight budget, do you have any cool honeymoon destinations that you can recommend?
Turn: Hi yes i will try my best to find the perfect location! what budget do you have in mind? Where are you from and Where are you thinking of going?
Turn: Actually, my bride, who is sitting next to me just told me that she wants to go to Porto! Do you have anything in Porto Alegre? We are getting married in Fort Lauderdale on August 18th, so we want to leave on our honeymoon on the 19th.  I CANNOT spend more than $4000.00 though.
Turn: So it seems that there are no packages available to Porto, is there anywhere else in mind?
Turn: Well, how about Guadalajara then. I heard it's still pretty dangerous there, but it apparently has some nice beaches! We just gotta keep it under $4000!
Turn: im sorry to tell you this but there seems to be no packages for there either, we have dominican republic if you are interested?
Turn: I heard the food sucks in Dominican Republic, but if it's within our budget and at least 6 days, I guess I'll take some info on Dominican Republic. Is it at least a five star hotel?
Turn: Actually there is only a 2.5 star  hotel
Turn: Okay this really sucks, is that all you can offer me? No Porto, no Guadalajara and a crappy hotel in Dominican Republic. Surely you must have other destinations on August 19th???
Turn: We have a 9 day trip starting on August 29th to Mexico City in a 3.0 star hotel called Sublime Echo
Turn: That does not work for us, we have to leave on the 19th and I only have a week off work. Have a nice day.
Turn: it seems that there are packages to Porto but only later in august are you flexible with your dates?
Turn: Like I said, we are NOT flexible. The wedding is already planned for the 18th. Good bye.

Turn: I am leaving from London. I want your absolute  best hotel in Atlanta, whichever one is known for having celebrities stay there.

Turn: Hmmm it's a little bit too expensive... they have another location in Kingston, can we see what's available there?
Turn: I have a lot available in Kingston within your travel dates. Are there any special amenities you are looking for at the hotel?
Turn: Hmmm well this is the first time I book any kind of vacation... Can you tell me what amenities are usually offered?
Turn: In Kingston, I have hotels available from a 2.5 rated hotel to a 4 star hotel. I also have some hotels that are located near the museum for when you have some leisure time.

Turn: How many are you?
Turn: A total of 6 adults. We're all trying to find Pokemon.
Turn: Where are you located?
Turn: Barcelona. I should also mention that we have a budget of 17400 dollars.

Turn: That sounds pretty good! Otherwise do you have anything close to the beach?
Turn: I apologize. All of our resorts  located close to the beach in either Kingston or Lima have already been booked up. Would you like to look at other possible destinations?

Turn: Ok! If we increased our budget to 15200, would there be other packages you would recommend for Lima?

Turn: Where do you live and do you have a wish list of places to go?
Turn: We live in Los Angeles and we don't have any places in mind, we are just looking to stay at a nice beach resort where we can swim in the ocean, tan, play with the kids on the beach, have some drinks at night, that kind of thing
Turn: When will you be taking your vacation?
Turn: Between August 27th and September 3rd!!
Turn: You are in luck, We have availability at the Glorious Cloak Inn in St. Louis, which is located right by the beach. This is a 4 day package which included wifi and free buffet breakfast for the whole family. This is a 3 star hotel with a 7.15/10 guest rating.
Turn: Do you have anything longer? We were hoping for about a one week package. It's quite a hassle to fly with the kids so once we get there we want to stay longer than 4 days
Turn: I have a package available out of Los Angeles flying out to Columbus. This one would be at the Crown Jungle Inn and it is a 6 day long package. It also includes wifi and parking but breakfast is not included. The good news is, it is also close to the beach.
Turn: That could be cool! What are the dates and the price for this one?
Turn: The price is $7796.72USD and the dates from August 27 to Sept 1st. This is price is based on an economy class flight.
Turn: ok thanks! Ya we would be flying economy. The only thing is that i'm not sure how warm the water is in Columbus, do you have any packages for further south? We are really looking for a tropical beach kind of vacation :slightly_smiling_face:
Turn: St. Louis and Columbus are the only places available that are on the beach at the moment.
Turn: Oh no! What if the end date was flexible? It's less ideal but we could be back as late as September 14th if that gives us better options. And we don't need to leave exactly August 27th, as long as the trip is about a week long.
Turn: Do you have a budget for this trip?
Turn: We don't have a budget set, but like I said we want to fly in economy
Turn: I have the Summer Covert Club located in Atlanta, United States, also on the beach. This one here is a 7 day package that is available to you from September 8th to September 14th also on economy class for 3463.11USD.
Turn: That sounds good! How fancy is this hotel?
Turn: It is a 3.5 star hotel with free wifi and free parking. It is a brand new hotel so it does not have any guest ratings yet.

Turn: Alright, scratch that. How about for Brasilia?
Turn: There are no available flights from Monterrey to Brasilia. Would you like to look at package number one again, the one to Porto? That package seemed to suit your dates and budget.

Turn: Hey there!
Turn: Good morning! How may I help you?
Turn: I’ve been tasked with booking my own little Brady bunch a dandy tripadoodle the end of this summer :smile: There’s me, my wife, and 7 little angels. We would like to check out our options in Mexico City, leaving from Munich, with a budget of 12600.
Turn: I'd love to help you with that! The first package I can offer you is a 7 day stay at Hotel Tropic which is close to the beach and shopping. It would be from September 2nd to 7th. Would those dates work for you?
Turn: Wow, yippee! That’s a stupendous sounding vacation! Oh yes, those dates are just fine. I guess I should’ve told ya earlier but we are free to travel from August 30th until September 12th.
Turn: Great! Should I book this one for you or would you like to consider more options?
Turn: I’ve gotta be good and thorough though, this trip is gonna set the standard for all our family getaways to come. What else is available?
Turn: Another option for your family would be to spend 7 days at the 3.5 star Exalted Willow Resort & Suites. This one is also close to the beach and would come out to 10688.56USD.
Turn: Oh, so how many stars was the Hotel Tropic spot you first mentioned?
Turn: That one had 3 stars.
Turn: Ok! Now, I have another destination that I’m interested.. are there any packages available if we went to San Diego?
Turn: In San Diego I can offer you a week long package at a 2.5 star hotel, Majestic Mountain Inn. It includes free breakfast, wifi and parking. The total cost of this holiday would be 10956.9USD.
Turn: Ok.. well, we are also thinking about visiting Essen as that’s where my wife’s family is from. Could you tell me anything about packages to Essen from Munich ?
Turn: Essen would be a much cheaper destination. I have an 8 day holiday package at the Relaxation Hotel available. You could fly in business class for 3702.62USD.
Turn: Hmm yes, of course. Far more affordable to travel domestically. I think Mexico City would be far more fun that seeing the crusty in-laws… Let’s go back to those packages. I think I’d like to book Exalted in Mexico City. It sounds very exotic and beautiful.
Turn: Sure! Would you like to go ahead with a booking or would you prefer if I check for more options?

Turn: Hello online, I am the happiest man on earth! I have 4 beautiful children, a beautiful wife, a great life and on top of it all my beautiful wife has now let me look after what we hope will be a beautiful vacation. I have $8600, let's look at some possible fun trips for me, plus my beautiful wife, PLUS my beautiful family.
Turn: I would be happy to help you with that! Where will you be departing from and do you have any destinations in mind?
Turn: We live in beautiful Frankfurt! I don't know, I was asked to look into Munich.
Turn: I have a luxury package to offer you:  A  six day stay at the Regal Bluff, a 5 star hotel close to a university. You could even fly there in business class for 1752.90USD and still be way under your budget. The dates of this package are from September 6th to 11th. Do those work for you?
Turn: We were hoping for a longer vacation! That one sounds very nice and luxurious but let's check out beautiful Paris?
Turn: The longest package I have for Paris is a 9 day holiday at the 4 star Autumn Treasure Hotel. Would you like more details about this option?

Turn: Ok so complimentary breakfast and wifi are included in the price of 2698.30USD. The package would be 3171.76USD if you preferred to fly in business class. The dates of your stay would be from August 31st to September 8th.
Turn: That one sounds pretty good. I need to look at your packages in Belem, see if there is anything on the beach there.
Turn: I have several options for you. The first is an 11 day holiday at the Zion Hotel. It is a 4.5 star hotel by the beach. The price includes free breakfast wifi and parking. The dates this package are from August 24th to September 2nd and it would cost you 5530.24USD.
Turn: That's a bit too soon for us
Turn: What dates would you prefer?
Turn: We can only travel during beautiful September from the 1st to the 14th
Turn: Then I can offer you a shorter stay at the same hotel from September 8th to the 14th. This 8 day package would cost you 4930.52USD in economy.
Turn: I kinda like this one myself! There's no way I can book without wifey's approval. I will let her know about all the fantastic packages you have available and we will call you back to confirm. Thank you for all your help, life is beautiful!
Turn: Glad to be of use! I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Turn: Good day, we are here to help you book your best trip possible. How can I help you today?
Turn: I've been rewarded with a company trip for me and some coworkers but the destination is a subject of conflict. Our parameters include the travel window being from August 30 until September 18
Turn: What destinations were you thinking of?
Turn: And we are looking at Osaka first of all. That would be for 6 adults, all leaving from Burlington
Turn: We have 2 choices in Osaka for 6 adults. The 4 star Aquamarine Majesty Hotel available for 13 days and the 3 star Hotel Opportunity available for 9 days. Any preference?
Turn: Those both sound very suitable. What would be the dates of travel for the Majesty Hotel
Turn: The Aquamarine Majesty Hotel is available from Sept 2nd to Sept 13. It is located by the park and museum and offers free wifi and free parking.
Turn: That sounds quite ideal. Just to appease some other difficult colleagues, what would be available in Mexico City for the same date range?
Lets search that for ... 2 adults
Turn: I have hotels available in Mexico City for 6 days and for 12 days. Do you prefer the 12 day stay?
Turn: Yes, please. The longer the better. What is the hotel like?
Turn: Your 12 day stay at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites, a 3.5 star rated hotel, will include free parking and free wifi. It is located near the beach and close to shopping. The dates of departure and return are Sept 2 to Sept 13.
Turn: Well, same dates for both.. ok.. I like both honestly. I guess lets see which package is cheaper. How much is the Majesty package in Osaka
Turn: The price for 6 adults at The Aquamarine Majesty Hotel is 19573.81USD. The price for 2 adults at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites in Mexico City is 2227.91USD.
Turn: That's great, thank you. Ok, so there are a lot of folks on my team I think...
Would both of these packages be available for 13 adults?
Turn: The Aquamarine Majesty has availability for 13 people at a cost of 42409.93USD. The Exalted in Mexico City also has availability for 13 at  14481.44USD.
Turn: I guess we should go with Mexico City as it is noticeably more affordable
Can you book that for me?
Turn: I will proceed with booking the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites in Mexico City for 13 people from September 2nd to September 13th, 2016. Confirmation will be sent to you shortly.
Turn: Thank you so much :smile: Can't wait!

Turn: I can book you in Buenos Aires from September 8th until the 19th for a total of 2754.1USD.
Turn: The 8th to 19th would work, although I am off work until the 28th. Can you tell me the name of the hotel & all the pertinent information so I can make a list?
Turn: Hotel Universe is a 3.5 star hotel, with an esteemed 8.69/10 from previous guests. Featured with your package are a daily breakfast buffet and access to wireless internet. This hotel is in the heart of the city located near lush green spaces to help you get the most of your getaway.
Turn: Hmmmm sounds like a good one but I want to see what else you have.  How many days total is this package?
Turn: 13
Turn: Next destination: Punta Cana
Turn: I have September 2-12th for 1129.3USD, business class flights included.
Turn: Was Buenos Aires on business class too? I need to keep them all on the same type of flight so that I am comparing apples to apples.
Turn: This package in Punta Cana would cost 846.85USD.
Turn: Okay let's keep them all in economy for now. Can you tell me the name of the hotel & all the pertinent information please?
Turn: La Estrella del Mar is an unrated hotel, near a palace, and the stay would be 11 days in duration. I also have shorter duration trips of 5 days at El Mar, a 2.5 star beachside hotel.

Turn: I also have a 9 day Belem package at a 4 star beachside hotel, Gentle Tower Resort.
Turn: How much is that one?
Turn: 2933.19USD
Turn: I think I'll stick to the 11 day package in Belem at Las Flores, seems like the best deal and it had a good user rating. Let's book that one.

Turn: I'm travelling alone ; helps me focus on my sensitive pallet
Turn: My hotels in Kingston go up to 4 stars and the length of stays between 4 days and ten days.

Turn: The only hotel I can see in Belo Horizonte is 2.5 stars. Do you have a maximum length of stay?

Turn: Ok. I can book 17 days for two adults at Tranquil Season Hotel for only 1332.83USD.

Turn: 3355.13 with economy flights and just 4335.7 for an upgrade to business class.
Turn: :heart_eyes: Would I be able to afford a trip to Rio de Janeiro?
Turn: Yes you can. You can afford to stay up to 16 days at a 3.0 star hotel near the park, museum, and university.
Turn: Would I have amenities included? What would I pay for that one?
Turn: The hotel's got everything covered! With free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The economy seats will cost you 4144.38.
Turn: Impressive!! Now, I may be being greedy here..
If I was to keep my sunshine spree domestic
And went to Atlanta..
I'm wondering if I could be under budget enough that I'd have enough left over for maybe another trip
Turn: That is actually very possible. For a 10 day stay in a 3.5 star beachside hotel, it will just be 1283.2 in business class and 962.67 in economy class.

Turn: The hotel has a rating of 8.86 out of 10 and you can do some great shopping in the area. Breakfast and wifi is included with the package, and it departs on Friday September 23rd, returning to Salvador on Friday October 7th.
Turn: k the 23rd should be good...enough time to prepare for the competition. I don't want to spend all my savings though...they don't need to fly on business class that;s for rich people. Whats it cost on economy?
Turn: The package with economy class would cost a total of 2204.67 USD.  Would you like me to book this package to Rosario for you?
